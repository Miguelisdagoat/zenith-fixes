### Troubleshoot: Zenith Injection Issues

If you're having trouble injecting Zenith, please try the following steps in order:

1. Disable Antivirus and Reinstall Zentih
> Turn off anti-tamper settings and real-time protection in your antivirus software.
> Then, clear your browser cache and reinstall Zenith using the packaged zip. <https://zenith.win>

2. Inject Inside a Game
> Only inject Zenith after joining a Roblox game. Not from the homepage.

3. Ignore Warning and Execute
> If you see an error or warning, try ignoring it and proceed to execute the script.

4. Try Injecting Twice
> Inject once, wait for it to time out, then try to inject again.

5. Reinstall Roblox
> Delete the Roblox folder from this location: `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Local\Roblox`
> -# Make sure to replace YourName with your actual Windows username.
> Then reinstall Roblox from the official site: <https://roblox.com/download>.

7. Use Bloxstrap
> Try launching Roblox with Bloxstrap: <https://bloxstraplabs.com/>

8. Use Fishtrap
> Alternatively, use Fishtrap: <https://fishstrap.app/>

### None of this worked? try restarting your pc and redoing every step.
